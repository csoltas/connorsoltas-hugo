### I’m a student at the University of Chicago studying applied math and computer science.

Somehow I ended up doing product design and software development [for tech companies and startups](http://linkedin.com/in/connorsoltas). This website is about those things.

I also help run my school’s major tech entrepreneurship community, [Edge](http://edge.uchicago.edu), by putting on events, coordinating UChicago’s student startup accelerator, and promoting the growing student entrepreneurship scene on campus and around Chicago.
